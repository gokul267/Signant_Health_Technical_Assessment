Improvement ideas for the application
-------------------------------------

1. Add pagination for APIs E.g. API GET /api/users

2. Data validation and help text in the UI. 
	- E.g. After successful user registration, the login page is displayed. There is no message displayed like 'user registered successfully', which makes the user guess that the registration is successful

3. User data validation can be enabled. 
	- Any data is currently accepted in the application for names, password and phone. 

4. Password lock, after multiple failed login attempts. 
	- This is critical as there are no password criteria set in the application. Captcha can also be enabled
	- An option to reset the password can also be enabled

5. Enable SSL implementation for application. 
	- User information is highly vulnerable in non SSL interfaces especially during login, register etc
